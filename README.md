# Awesome Bookmarks

> This project was bootstrapped with [

A need for a way to de-clutter my already fully crammed bookmarks bar arose at the office, mainly due to the sheer amount of links being shared every single day in our #developers Slack channel.

I used to save most in Toby Extension but there were an incident where i lost all of my bookmarks data, and thankfully i had them saved in Chrome in case something like this happened.
Cool üôÇÔ∏è. The only issue is Chrome bookmarks are limited in terms of functionalities. Apart from plain title/url search there wasn't much to it.

This project is an attempt to create a better "vault" for my bookmarks, where the usual basic functionalities are available out-of-the-box along with advanced search, tags, dead link verification and anything which might come in handy in the future.
